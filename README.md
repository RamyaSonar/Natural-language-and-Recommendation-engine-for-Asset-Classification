#### Description
Asset Classification Engine was developed which is a Web Application hosted on an AWS EC2 instance. To build this application, a Deep Learning based Long short-term memory (LSTM) model was trained to predict the asset classes based on Order Title and Line Description with an F1-score of 78%. To facilitate continuous learning and improvement, the model can be retrained with revised asset classes. Additionally, to identify the similar asset classes, an algorithm was developed that reduced their number by 92.76%. This algorithm and the model can provide maximum performance with large data and a balanced class distribution. To facilitate scalability and portability, a REST API was developed along with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for server interactions. The developed system will automate the asset classification and recommendation process to further improve the global supply chain by generating correct asset class labels automatically.
